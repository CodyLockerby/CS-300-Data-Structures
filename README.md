# CS-300-Final-Project

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This was not so much of a problem we were solving, but more of a lesson to learn. This course we were learning about different data storing stuctures and how they affect runtime. Learning the difference between linked lists, vectors, hashtables, binary trees and how each line needed incorporates into the total run time.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I know going into this course the material within would be crucial to my future career so I tried my best to take in as much as possible. I ensured I had plenty of time each week for the material and coursework to fully understand all the lessons being taught. Data structures hold a very important place in the development world and having a deep understanding of them and their properties will ensure my success in a future career. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I faced many roadblocks during my time since I had not had a class in C++ this in depth in a while. I relied on my learning material for the most part and what I could glean from their I turned to tutors with knowledge in C++ who were very helpful.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I am now more aware of how many data structures exist. I also understand how to estimate runtime for each of the based on what program I need a structure for. I also can tell which data structure may be the best for the program I am writing for.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using industry best practices has helped ensure that the code I write is easily maintained and readable. From this project I learned the value of naming practices because during a coding assignment I spent way to long without realizing my code was not working because I was using the wrong variable because I had named two very similar to each other.
